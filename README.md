## Description 📖

- This application was built using Mongoose, Javascript, NoSQL, and Express.js to build and test routes through Insomnia. We used CRUD methods to create Users, Friend's list for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions to Thoughts and also be able to remove them. This application doesn't have a front-end, but there is a walkthrough video demonstrating that the routes works.
